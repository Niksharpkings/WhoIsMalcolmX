  <h1>Who is Malcolm X?</h1>
  <h2>By Nik Sharpio</h2>
  <br />
  <p>Malcolm X was a well known and established civil rights activist and advocate for Black empowerment, while
    unjustified oppressions and societal norms about African-Americans before the 1970 were at it's hight, but with his
    prevailing powerful speeches and played a crucial role in the fight against racial injustice. He was also a
    spokesman for the Nation of Islam until 1964, when he embraced Sunni Islam and the civil rights movement after
    completing the Hajj to Mecca. He was assassinated in 1965 by members of the Nation of Islam.

  </p>
  <p>But his life story started at May 19, 1925, Omaha, Nebraska as his origin of birth
    and it ended in his Assassination: February 21, 1965, New York, New York <a href="www.britannica.com/biography/Malcolm-X">(source: (Mamiya))</a>,
    and/or his role in the Black Panther Party founded by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale after his his assassination “and
    after police in San Francisco shot and killed an unarmed Black teen named Matthew Johnson. Originally dubbed the
    Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, the organization was founded in October 1966. The Black Panthers’ early
    activities primarily involved monitoring police activities in Black communities in Oakland and other
    cities.”(History.com Editors)<a href="www.history.com/topics/black-history/black-panthers">(source: (History.com Editors))</a>.

  <p>Malcolm was raised in a family of early Garveyites who headed the local chapter of UNIA (Universal Negro
    Improvement Association) during his youth. His parents deeply respected Marcus Garvey's teachings, instilling in
    young Malcolm a sense of black nationalism and pride that would shape his future. Tragically, when Malcolm was just
    six years old, his father Earl was killed in a mysterious accident that some believed was the result of a racist
    white group near their home in Lansing, Michigan. This event had a profound impact on Malcolm, fueling his mistrust
    and anger towards white people and setting him on a path towards activism and self-determination.
