    <h1>Who is Malcolm X?</h1>
    <br/>
    <h2>Who is Malcolm X?</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>Malcolm X was a well known and established civil rights activist and advocate for Black empowerment, while unjustified oppressions and societal norms about African-Americans before the 1970 were at it's hight, but with his prevailing powerful speeches and played a crucial role in the fight against racial injustice[^1^][1]. He was also a spokesman for the Nation of Islam until 1964, when he embraced Sunni Islam and the civil rights movement after completing the Hajj to Mecca[^2^][2]. He was assassinated in 1965 by members of the Nation of Islam[^2^][2].</p>
    <br/>
    <p>But his life story started at May 19, 1925, Omaha, Nebraska as his origin of birth
      and it ended in his Assassination: February 21, 1965, New York, New York (Mamiya)),
      and/or his role in the Black Panther Party founded by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale after his his assassination “and after police in San Francisco shot and killed an unarmed Black teen named Matthew Johnson. Originally dubbed the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, the organization was founded in October 1966.
      The Black Panthers’ early activities primarily involved monitoring police activities in Black communities in Oakland and other cities.”(History.com Editors).
      Malcolm excelled in school, but lost interest after eight-grade and ended up being rebellious enough to be moved to Michigan State Detention Home, a Juvenile Home.
      After Juvenile he moved to Roxbury, Boston to live with an older half sister, Ella, but he became involved in doing petty criminal activities as a teen.
      He later developed as a street hustler, drug dealer, and a leader of a gang of thieves in Roxbury and Harlem (in New York City).
      In 1946-1952, Malcolm was in prison for robbery/burglary and while there he underwent a conversion eventually led him to join the Nation of Islam, an African American Movement that combined elements of Islam with Black Nationalism. Following Nation tradition, he replaced his surname, “Little,” with an “X,” a custom among Nation of Islam followers who considered their family names to have originated with white slaveholders(Mamiya).
      After prison Malcolm went to Chicago, where he met Elijah Muhammad, Began organizing temples for the Nation in New York, Philadelphia, Boston and in cities in the South and also founded the Nation’s newspaper, but later would become minister of Boston Temple No.11 and then Harlem Temple No.7 where he would later be named the National Representative of the Nation of Islam (Mamiya).
      He then became a well known public speaker where he preached through the Civil Rights Movement from 1965 to 1965 with Martin Luther King, Jr., but they had contrasting differences in how they influenced their followers, with some criticism.
      Malcolm’s vision of black nationalism, which did not rule out violence as a means of overcoming white oppression, was met with fear and skepticism from mainstream white audiences and quickly attracted the attention of the FBI(Youtube).
      In 1963, Malcolm left the Nation organization and went to Mecca in Cairo to reaffirm his faith and cultivate his hopes for a peaceful resolution for the struggle for racial equality, but on his return to New York, while still facing death threats from Elijoah Muhammad, continue doing speeches and sharing his beliefs to his followers.
      On May 29, 1964, Malcolm did a symposium, “What’s Behind the Harlem ‘Hate-Gang’ Scare?” at the Socialist Workers party’s (S.W.P.) Militant Labor Forum, 116 University Pl, New York, N.Y. (Lee).
      On February 21, 1965, before a speech in Manhattan’s Audubon Ballroom, Malcolm X was shot to death by three members of the Nation of Islam(Youtube).</p>
